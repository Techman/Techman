Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Michael, an early-career Software Engineer. Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile!

I would say that most of my programming experience is in backend systems. I work with **C++**, **Java**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**, but I am always experimenting with new languages and technologies.

I enjoy working on [Internet Relay Chat](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_Relay_Chat) (IRC) projects as a hobby. In fact, that is how I got into programming in the first place: I wanted to modify my IRC network's [IRC daemon](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/IRCd). C++ is the first programming language I learned. Some would say that I got into programming "the hard way." C++ is certainly not the easiest language to pick up, but I enjoy it.

Outside of programming, I enjoy playing video games, spending time with friends and family, and spending a little time outdoors. If you want to get in touch with me, send me an email or message me on IRC. I am `Techman` on [Techtronix](https://www.techtronix.net/) and most other networks (including [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/)).
